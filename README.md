# DAGAN
Property Prediction of Energetic Materials Based on Directional-Aware Graph Attention Network
We propose DAGAN, a novel Directional-Aware Graph Attention Network designed to accurately predict explosive properties of energetic materials. By incorporating fine-grained atomic features and topological environments, DAGAN captures both local atomic interactions and global molecular structures, outperforming traditional machine learning models such as SVM, RF, and XGBoost.
